# Introduction to React UseMidi

UseMidi is designed as a the foundation for React design systems and component libraries.
It sets you up for success in creating accesible, interactive, performant UI
that support the custom look and feel of you

## Modern React #
Made with modern React APIs including function components and hooks.
Ready for use with modern React APIs including Concurrent Mode and Server Components.

## Modular views and behaviors #
UseMidi exports a number of individual modules to support a variety of use cases.
Your application can use as many or as few of these modules as needed.
The library is designed for incremental adoption strategies.

```js
// React DOM element DOES have event callback props
<div onClick={onClick} />

// UseMidi element DOES NOT have event callback props
const bind = UseNote(state => {});
<div {...bind()}/>
```

## Installation

To install the entire `use-midi` lib:
```shell
npm i use-midi
```

or

```shell
yarn add use-midi
```

## Getting Started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tseijp/use-midi
```

Run the development server:

```shell
cd use-midi
yarn init
yarn start
```

Your site starts at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Simple example

import styled from 'styled-components'

export const StyledComponent = styled.div`
    width: 100%;
    height: 25rem;
    border-radius: .5rem;
    background: pink;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    button {
        border-radius: 100rem;
        width: 15rem;
        height: 15rem;
        color: black;
    };
`

import { useNote } from 'use-midi/src'

export function ClickButton (props) {
    const bind = useNote(state => {
        if (state.first)
            state.send?.([0x000, 0x888, 0xfff], 10)
    })
    return <button {...bind}>Click Button and Send Data to MIDI</button>
}

<StyledComponent>
  <ClickButton />
</StyledComponent>

The following example makes a `<button/>`

```js
import { useNote } from 'use-midi'

function ClickButton () {
  const bind = useNote(state => {
    state.send?.([0x000, 0x888, 0xfff], 10)
  })
  return <button {...bind}>Send Data to MIDI</button>
}
```
